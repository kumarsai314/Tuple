#1. Tuple is like list, except that it is immutable.
Question:
[MCQ] Which of the following declarations is a tuple with 1 element? 
a) t = (1,) (True)
b) t = (1)
c) t = [1]
d) t = ((1))
e) None of the above

#2. Tuple is like list, except that it is immutable. However, the elements in a tuple can be mutable.
Question:
[MCQ] Which of the following operation on a tuple 't' is valid?
       t=((1,2), [3,4]) 
a) t2 = (1,2)
       t.extend(t2) 
b) t.remove([3,4])
c) t+=([5,6],) (True)
d) t[0][1]=3
e) None of the above

#3.The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is the product of the elements on the main diagonal minus the product of the elements off the main diagonal.

#4.Write a function hasSameContent(t1, t2) that takes in two tuples as arguments and return True if both tuples contain the same items.
# Answer:
def hasSameContent(t1, t2):
    if(len(t1) != len(t2)):
        return False
    return sorted(t1)==sorted(t2) 
    
#5.In python, it is possible to pass in variable-length argument to a function by using the following notation: *args. The argument is passed in as a tuple.

    def funA(*args):
        print type(args)
        print args
        
    >>> funA(1, 3, 5)
    <type 'tuple'>
    (1, 3, 5)
    
    >>> funA('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
    <type 'tuple'>
    ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
Write a function sumNumbers(*args) that takes in a variable-length argument list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.

#Answer:

def sumNumbers(*args):
   
    return sum(args)
    
#6. Write a function commonElements(t1, t2) that takes in 2 tuples as arguments and returns a sorted tuple containing elements that are found in both tuples.

#Answer: 

def commonElements(t1,t2):
    return tuple((sorted(set(t1) & set(t2))))
    
    
 #7.Write a function removeCommonElements(t1, t2) that takes in 2 tuples as arguments and returns a sorted tuple containing elements that are not found in both tuples.
 
 #Answer:
 def removeCommonElements(t1,t2):
    return tuple((sorted(set(t1) ^ set(t2))))
    
 #8. Write a function shiftByTwo(*args) that takes in variable-length argument and returns a tuple with its elements shifted to the right by two indices. See samples given below.

#Answer:

def shiftByTwo(*args):
    return args[len(args)-2:len(args)] + args[0:len(args)-2]
    
#9.Write a function sortByIndex(aList) that takes in a list of tuple in the following format: (index, value) and returns a new tuple with its elements sorted based on the index.


#10. Write a function sortByLength(t, order) that takes in a tuple of string and returns a new tuple with its elements sorted by the length of the string. The order of sorting is based on the value of the second argument: 'asc' or 'des'.
